/*

Given two numbers x and y, and a range [l, r] where 1 <= l, r <= 32. 
The task is consider set bits of y in range [l, r] and set these bits in x also. 
Examples :

Input  : x = 10, y = 13, l = 2, r = 3
Output : x = 14
Binary representation of 10 is 1010 and 
that of y is 1101. There is one set bit
in y at 3â€™rd position (in given range). 
After we copy this bit to x, x becomes 1110
which is binary representation of 14.

Input  : x = 8, y = 7, l = 1, r = 2
Output : x = 11
